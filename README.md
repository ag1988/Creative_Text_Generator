# Creative_Text_Generator
Author: Ankit Gupta
Description: A deep recurrent neural net (RNN) for both character-level and word-level language modeling that, given any starting context, generates creative text depending on the training data. Training was done using OANC corpus. Even with probabilistic sampling of character sequences, the RNN almost always outputs valid dictionary words making meaningful sentences.
